## ðŸ’¯ 100 Days of Code: Python Challenge    

This repository documents my journey of learning **Python** in 100 days! ðŸš€ Each day, I tackle new concepts, work on projects, and share my progress. From mastering the basics to building real-world applications, this challenge is all about consistency, growth, and having fun with code!  

### ðŸŒŸ What's Inside:  
- Daily progress updates  
- Hands-on projects (like Rock-Paper-Scissors ðŸŽ®)  
- Code snippets & challenges  
- Reflections and key takeaways  

### ðŸ“… Goal:  
Learn Python step-by-step, practice daily, and build confidence to apply it in real-world scenarios!  

### ðŸ§© Quick Revision:  
import random  

random_int = random.randint(1,10)  
print(random_int)  

random_decimal_0_to_1 = random.random() *10  
print(random_decimal)  

random_float = random.uniform(0,10)  
print(random_float)
